The application purpose is to sort students by their performance. System UI is written in  Swing and allows user to select a text file with student data, sorting algorithm and display result in table with an option to save it to a file. \
It is unsure how many students will have to be sorted, we would like you to implement Bubble, Heap and Merge sorting algorithms, but enable system design to be easily extendable in future. \
To simplify benchmarking the application provides number of records and sorting time. \
\
Input file example: \
... \
Student1,8.5 \
Student2,6.5 \
Student3,5.0 \
.... \
